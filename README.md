OpenPGPEncyptTest
=================

OpenPGP JS library encryption test. This project is based around encryptor.js, an adapter class for the OpenPGP library. This project also includes a basic UI to generate a key pair and encrypt/decrypt a message.

Todo
----
- Implement a timer to analyze key generation time for various key sizes.
- Seperate the encryption/decryption functions to each initiate a seperate openPGP object (to simulate sending and receiving the data at two seperate points).
 
Project Goals
------------
- Develop a strong adapter object to interact with the OpenPGP JS library.
- Analyze perfromance of key generation
